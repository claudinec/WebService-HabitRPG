# ABSTRACT: A HabitRPG task

# VERSION: Generated by DZP::OurPkg:Version

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $task = WebService::HabitRRG::Task->new(
        text  => 'Floss teeth',
        id    => 'a670fc50-4e04-4b0f-9583-e4ee55fced02',
        up    => 1,
        down  => 0,
        value => 0,
        type  => 'habit',
    );

    say "Task name: ", $task->text;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Represents a HabitRPG task object. All properties shown in the
synopsis are checked for sanity and are available as methods.

The C<history>, C<completed> and C<repeat> attributes may also
be provided at build-time, but are optional. No checking is done
on them (yet).

Returns a true value if this task is due today. To check if it's
already completed, check C< $task->completed >.
